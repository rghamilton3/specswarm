# SpecSwarm Modify Workflow

Provides natural language access to `/ss:modify` command.

## When to Invoke

Trigger this skill when the user mentions:
- Modifying, changing, or updating existing feature behavior
- Enhancing or extending working features
- Altering how something works (that currently works)
- Making features work differently than they do now
- Refactoring code for quality improvement (without changing behavior)
- Deprecating or sunsetting features

**Examples:**
- "Change authentication from session to JWT"
- "Add pagination to the user list API"
- "Update search to use full-text search"
- "Modify the dashboard to show real-time data"
- "Extend the API to support filtering"
- "Refactor this module to reduce complexity" → uses `--refactor`
- "Deprecate the v1 API" → uses `--deprecate`
- "What's the impact of changing the user model?" → uses `--analyze-only`

**NOT for this skill:**
- Fixing bugs (use ss-fix)
- Building new features (use ss-build)

## Instructions

**Skill-Based Routing:**

1. **Detect** that user mentioned modifying/changing existing functionality
2. **Extract** the modification description from their message
3. **Route based on intent clarity**:

   **Clear intent** - Execute directly:
   - Clear modification requests: "Change authentication from session to JWT", "Add pagination to user list API", "Update search algorithm to use full-text search"
   - Clear refactor requests: "Refactor this module to reduce complexity", "Clean up the utils to reduce duplication"
   - Clear deprecation requests: "Deprecate the v1 API", "Sunset the legacy auth system"
   - Action: Immediately run the appropriate command:
     - Standard modify: `/ss:modify "modification description"`
     - Refactor: `/ss:modify "target" --refactor`
     - Deprecate: `/ss:modify "target" --deprecate`
     - Impact analysis only: `/ss:modify "target" --analyze-only`

   **Ambiguous intent** - Ask for confirmation:
   - Less specific: "Update the authentication", "Make the feature better"
   - Action: Use AskUserQuestion tool with two options:
     - Option 1 (label: "Run /ss:modify"): Use SpecSwarm's workflow
     - Option 2 (label: "Process normally"): Handle as regular Claude Code request

4. **If user selects Option 2**, process normally without SpecSwarm
5. **After command completes**, STOP - do not continue with ship/merge

## What the Modify Command Does

`/ss:modify` runs complete workflow:
- Analyzes impact and backward compatibility
- Identifies breaking changes
- Creates migration plan if needed
- Updates specification and plan
- Generates modification tasks
- Implements changes
- Validates against regression tests

Stops after modification is complete - does NOT merge/ship/deploy.

## Semantic Understanding

This skill should trigger not just on exact keywords, but semantic equivalents:

**Modify equivalents**: modify, change, update, adjust, enhance, extend, alter, revise, adapt, transform, convert
**Refactor equivalents**: refactor, clean up, reorganize, simplify, reduce complexity, eliminate duplication, improve naming, optimize structure
**Deprecate equivalents**: deprecate, sunset, retire, phase out, remove feature, end-of-life
**Impact analysis equivalents**: what's the impact, analyze impact, dependency analysis, blast radius
**Target terms**: feature, functionality, behavior, workflow, process, mechanism, system, module, component

**Distinguish from:**
- **Fix** (broken/not working things): "fix", "repair", "resolve", "debug"
- **Build** (new things): "build", "create", "add", "implement new"

## Example

```
User: "Change authentication from session to JWT"

Claude: 🎯 Running /ss:modify... (press Ctrl+C within 3s to cancel)

[Executes /ss:modify "Change authentication from session to JWT"]
```

```
User: "Refactor the utils module to reduce complexity"

Claude: 🎯 Running /ss:modify --refactor... (press Ctrl+C within 3s to cancel)

[Executes /ss:modify "utils module" --refactor]
```

```
User: "Deprecate the v1 API"

Claude: 🎯 Running /ss:modify --deprecate... (press Ctrl+C within 3s to cancel)

[Executes /ss:modify "v1 API" --deprecate]
```

```
User: "What would be the impact of changing the user model?"

Claude: 🎯 Running /ss:modify --analyze-only...

[Executes /ss:modify "user model" --analyze-only]
```

```
User: "Update the authentication"

Claude: [Shows AskUserQuestion]
1. Run /ss:modify - Use SpecSwarm's workflow
2. Process normally - Handle as regular Claude Code request

User selects Option 1
```
