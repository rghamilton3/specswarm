## Core Workflows

These 5 commands handle the vast majority of daily development work. **Start here** if you're new to SpecSwarm.

### `/ss:init`

Initialize SpecSwarm in your project with interactive setup wizard.

**Usage:**
```bash
/ss:init
```

**What it does:**
- Creates `.specswarm/` directory structure
- Generates `tech-stack.md` with your technology choices
- Creates `quality-standards.md` with validation gates
- Sets up `constitution.md` for project governance
- Configures performance budgets
- *(v6.1.0)* Auto-discovers spec corpus, reference codebases, and memory dirs; writes `references.md` for `/ss:specify` and `/ss:clarify` to consult
- *(v6.2.0)* Scans declared memory dirs for `feedback_*.md` rules; proposes constitution principles in hook-enforceable format; user accepts/rejects each; accepted principles append to `constitution.md` and trigger PostToolUse hook regeneration
- *(v6.3.0)* Each proposed principle gets a `severity:` field (warn | block); gravity signals in source memory (`must NEVER`, `trade secret`, `compliance`, `leak`, `pii`, etc.) auto-propose `severity: block` — the dispatcher returns `decision: block` on violation so Claude reverts/fixes instead of just being warned. Also fixes a v5.3.0 path-glob bug that had silently prevented every relative-form glob from firing in production

**When to use:**
- First-time project setup
- Adding SpecSwarm to existing projects (especially those with existing PRDs / decision logs / legacy reference codebases)

## Autonomous Loop (v7.1.0–v7.10.0)

These nine commands implement SpecSwarm's autonomous chunk execution loop. They compose with the core 5 — none of them replace any existing command; each adds a specific automation surface. Together they replace the dual mentor↔builder session pattern.

### `/ss:preflight` (v7.1.0)

Deterministic 5-check validator for a feature's `plan.md`. Catches version pins not anchored in tech-stack, missing memory references, unresolvable §X.Y refs, ambiguous grep patterns, and quoted-heading drift. Runs in <5 seconds with zero LLM cost.

**Usage:** `/ss:preflight [--feature NUM] [--json] [--quiet]`

**Project-agnostic via:** auto-detected package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun/pip/poetry/uv/cargo/go/gem), `.specswarm/references.md` for spec corpus + memory dirs.

---

### `/ss:notify` (v7.2.0)

Fire a notification with cascading fallback: convocli-notifier plugin → `notify-send` → `osascript` → terminal bell. Supports `--urgent`, `--success`, `--info` urgency tiers.

**Usage:** `/ss:notify [--urgent|--success|--info] [--title TITLE] [MESSAGE]`

**Programmatic:** `bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/notify.sh urgent "title" "msg"` — works from any script.

---

### `/ss:intervention` (v7.3.0)

Capture "wait, something feels off" moments as durable training-data memory files. Each intervention is a 4-field observation (noticed / should-have-caught / prevention / status) classified as `intervention_*.md` in the project's memory dir.

**Usage:** `/ss:intervention [NOTICED] [--should TEXT] [--prevent TEXT] [--status open|graduated|wontfix] [--list [N]]`

---

### `/ss:verify` (v7.4.0)

Adversarial spec-vs-code verification. Dispatches a fresh-context `spec-mentor` subagent (opus, read-only) that returns PASS / DRIFT / NEEDS-MARTY. Auto-queue is populated by the v7.4.0 `PostToolUse tasks-completion-detector.sh` hook when `- [ ] T###` flips to `- [X] T###`. Stop-hook surfaces pending verifications at every Claude pause.

**Usage:** `/ss:verify [TASK_ID] [--all] [--feature NUM] [--queue]`

---

### `/ss:retrospective` (v7.5.0)

Auto-distill a completed chunk's lessons into 1–3 durable memory files via the `chunk-retrospective` subagent (opus, Write access). Reads git log, tasks.md, verify-queue outcomes, captured interventions, MEMORY.md (for dedup). Each entry is classified as `feedback_*` / `project_*` / `intervention_*`. Run BEFORE `/ss:ship` so the new memory files land in the squash commit.

**Usage:** `/ss:retrospective [FEATURE_NUM] [--parent BRANCH] [--dry-run]`

---

### `/ss:decisions` (v7.6.0)

Pre-batch every strategic decision a chunk needs into ONE upfront `AskUserQuestion` touchpoint. Hybrid deterministic scan + `decision-miner` subagent (opus) for triage. Writes `decision-sheet.md` AND appends a "Pre-Batched Decisions" section to plan.md so `/ss:tasks` and `/ss:implement` apply the answers without code changes.

**Usage:** `/ss:decisions [FEATURE_NUM] [--scan-only] [--dry-run]`

---

### `/ss:dry-run` (v7.8.0)

Predict the chunk's full execution path WITHOUT running it. The `dry-run-simulator` subagent (opus) reads available artifacts + foundation + memory + intervention/verify history, writes a 9-section `dry-run.md` (anticipated decisions, risk register, out-of-scope guards, memory gaps, touchpoint estimate, predicted artifacts, commit cadence, recommendations). Re-runnable; each invocation sharpens the prediction.

**Usage:** `/ss:dry-run [FEATURE_NUM] [--phase auto|plan|tasks|decisions|implement] [--history-limit N]`

---

### `/ss:watchdog` (v7.9.0)

Background bash daemon that polls git + verify-queue every N seconds (default 30s). Auto-enqueues newly-checked tasks from new commits via commit-range diff. Fires `ss_notify urgent` on flagged-count growth. Completes v7.4.0's verification loop out-of-session — Marty can walk away and the watchdog still catches things.

**Usage:** `/ss:watchdog [start|stop|status|logs|once] [--interval N] [--with-verify] [--tail N]`

**State:** `.specswarm/watchdog.{pid,log,state}` — per-project, single-instance via PID file.

---

### `/ss:overnight` (v7.10.0)

The full unattended chunk run. Combines pre-batched decisions + verification queue + headless `claude --print` to execute `/ss:preflight → /ss:implement → /ss:verify → /ss:retrospective` without user input. **Default mode is `check` (validate readiness, no execution).** `exec` is the opt-in that actually dispatches.

**Usage:** `/ss:overnight [check|status|logs|exec|abort|schedule] [FEATURE_NUM] [--timeout SECONDS] [--allow-dirty]`

**Strict autonomous prompt enforces:** no AskUserQuestion, no /ss:ship, no push. On unanswered decision, writes `overnight-unanswered.md` and exits.

**Scheduler integration:** `/ss:overnight schedule` prints copy-paste cron / systemd timer / launchd plist snippets. Note: the `/schedule` plugin runs in Anthropic's remote infrastructure and can't touch local filesystems — use local OS schedulers instead.

---

## Internal Commands

These commands are used internally by the core workflows. They're hidden from command listings but can be called directly for re-running individual steps.

### `/ss:specify`

Create detailed feature specification from natural language description.

**Usage:**
```bash
/ss:specify "Add user authentication with email/password"
```

**What it creates:**
```
.specswarm/features/001-user-authentication/spec.md
```

**Specification includes:**
- Feature objectives
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical constraints
- Dependencies

**v6.1.0 — External Reference Corpus consultation:**

When `.specswarm/references.md` is populated, `/ss:specify` reads every declared spec corpus path and memory directory before generating spec content. Corpus content is treated as canonical — quoted/paraphrased with citations (`per <path> §X`) rather than fabricated. Generated spec.md gains a `## Sources` section and an optional `references_consulted:` YAML frontmatter field. When references.md is absent, behavior is identical to v6.0.0.

Called by: `build` (Step 2)

---

### `/ss:clarify`

Ask up to 5 targeted clarification questions and encode answers into specification.

**v6.1.0 — Corpus-aware question filtering:**

When references.md is populated, each candidate clarification question is cross-checked against the corpus before being asked. Categories: **CORPUS-RESOLVED** (drop and inject corpus answer with citation), **CORPUS-PARTIAL** (keep but pre-load corpus-suggested options), **CORPUS-SILENT** (proceed normally), **CORPUS-CONFLICT** (blocking question — spec disagrees with corpus). Final report surfaces "Auto-resolved from references (N)" sub-list. When references.md is absent, behavior is identical to v6.0.0.

Called by: `build` (Step 3)

---

### `/ss:plan`

Design implementation plan with tech stack validation.

Called by: `build` (Step 4)

---

### `/ss:tasks`

Generate actionable, dependency-ordered task breakdown.

Called by: `build` (Step 5)

---

### `/ss:implement`

Execute implementation plan with comprehensive quality validation.

Called by: `build` (Step 6)

---

### `/ss:validate`

Browser automation validation with Playwright flow testing.

Called by: `build --validate`

---

### `/ss:analyze-quality`

Comprehensive codebase quality analysis with prioritized recommendations.

**Quality Score (0-100):**
- Unit Tests (25 pts)
- Code Coverage (25 pts)
- Integration Tests (15 pts)
- Browser Tests (15 pts)
- Bundle Size (20 pts)

Called by: `build` (Step 8), `ship` (Step 2)

---

### `/ss:bugfix`

Regression-test-first bugfix workflow with auto-retry (max 2 attempts).

Called by: `fix` (internal)

---

### `/ss:hotfix`

Expedited emergency response workflow for critical production issues. Minimal ceremony, fast diagnosis, essential testing only.

Called by: `fix --hotfix` (internal)

---

### `/ss:complete`

Alias for `/ss:ship` - validates quality and merges feature.

Called by: `ship` (internal). Alias for ship.

---

### `/ss:constitution`

Create or update project constitution from interactive inputs. Generates `.specswarm/constitution.md` with project principles, code standards, decision-making guidelines, and technology preferences.

Called by: `init` (internal)

---

|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/ss:build` | New features | Building something that doesn't exist |
| `/ss:fix` | Bug fixes | Something is broken or not working |
| `/ss:modify` | Change behavior | Working feature needs to work differently |

---

## Workflow Patterns

### Standard Feature Development

```bash
/ss:build "feature description"
# Or manually:
/ss:specify -> /ss:clarify -> /ss:plan ->
/ss:tasks -> /ss:implement -> /ss:ship
```

### Bug Fixing

```bash
/ss:fix "bug description"
# Or for critical issues:
/ss:fix --hotfix "emergency description"
```

### Changing Existing Features

```bash
/ss:modify "change description"
```

### Technology Upgrades

```bash
/ss:upgrade "upgrade description"
```

### Pre-Release Checklist

```bash
/ss:analyze-quality
/ss:ship --security-audit
/ss:release
```

### Unattended Chunk (v7.10.0)

```bash
# 9pm — pre-batch decisions
/ss:decisions

# Optional safety net — start the watchdog daemon
/ss:watchdog start

# 10pm — cron fires automatically (see /ss:overnight schedule for snippets)
# Headless Claude runs preflight → implement → verify → retrospective

# 7am — wake to phone notification; check verdict
/ss:overnight status
/ss:ship  # human sign-off + merge
```

---

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use `/ss:init` first** - Sets up proper foundation
2. **Define tech-stack.md early** - Prevents technology drift
3. **Run `/ss:analyze-quality` before shipping** - Catch issues early
4. **Enable quality gates** - Maintain >80% scores
5. **Use `--background` for long builds** - Check progress with `/ss:status`
6. **Use `--orchestrate` for complex features** - Parallel execution speeds up builds
7. **Call internal commands directly** - Re-run individual steps without restarting the whole workflow
